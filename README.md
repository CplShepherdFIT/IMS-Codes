# IMS-Codes

This repository contains a collection of codes and scripts related to the **IMS** course on **VUT FIT**.

The codes are (mostly) organized by their names, as `{numeric method}_{type of simulation}.c`.

Anyone is free to contribute to this repository by submitting a **pull request** with their own codes or improvements to existing ones. I urge people to **follow the guidelines** below, which are in **most-important to least-important** order:

<ol>
    <li>The code should compile and run without errors.</li>
    <li>The code should compile without warnings.</li>
    <li>The code shouldn't use any global variables (this might not be possible somtimes).</li>
    <li>The code should be as clean as possible.</li>
    <li>The code should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of functions important sections of code.</li>
    <li>The code should follow a consistent coding style (e.g., indentation, naming conventions).</li>
</ol>

I'm not an expert in IMS, so if there are any mistakes in the codes, please feel free to correct them.
